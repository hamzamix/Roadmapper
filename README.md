![Roadmapper Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/u74Yg4m.png)

Roadmapper is a production-ready, client-side web application for project management, roadmapping, and idea note-taking. It's designed with a clean, minimalistic, and highly functional UI inspired by modern tools like Notion and Linear.

This application runs entirely in your browser, using `localStorage` to persist all your data. There is no backend, no database, and no need for user authentication, making it a perfect tool for personal projects or quick-start team planning.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Project Management**: Create, edit, and delete projects with titles, descriptions, and custom logos.
- **Roadmap & Ideas**: Each project has its own roadmap board to manage ideas.
- **Rich Text Descriptions**: Use Markdown (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `[links](...)`) in your idea descriptions for better formatting.
- **Idea Categorization**:
  - **Type**: Assign a type to each idea (`Add`, `Edit`, `Remove`).
  - **Priority**: Prioritize ideas with `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, or `Urgent` levels.
  - **Due Dates**: Set optional due dates, with visual indicators for overdue items.
- **Advanced Task Management**:
  - **Pinning**: Mark ideas as "To-do first" to pin them to the top of the list.
  - **Status Tracking**: Mark ideas as "Done" to track completion.
  - **Archiving**: Archive ideas to declutter your board without permanently deleting them.
- **Powerful Filtering & Sorting**:
  - Filter ideas by type (`Add`, `Edit`, `Remove`) or view `Archived` items.
  - Sort ideas by creation date, priority, name (A-Z), or due date.
- **Intuitive UI**:
  - **Dashboard Views**: Switch between a main project dashboard and a "Recent Ideas" feed.
  - **Search**: Instantly search for projects and ideas.
  - **Responsive Design**: A seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Customization**:
  - **Light & Dark Themes**: Toggle between themes with a beautiful, animated switch.
  - **Persistent Settings**: Your theme preference is saved locally.
- **Zero Backend**: All data is securely stored in your browser's `localStorage`. No sign-up required.
